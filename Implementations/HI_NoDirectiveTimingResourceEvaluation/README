HI_NoDirectiveTimingResourceEvaluation pass is tested by LLVM_expxxxxx

Compared to HI_SimpleTimingEvaluation, HI_NoDirectiveTimingResourceEvaluation will access the database to get the accurate information 
of the instruction, including timing and resource, to achieve accurate timing evaluation.

However, in this pass, the HLS directives will still not work, which will be enabled in the next step.
