The HI_IntstructionMoveBackward pass is used to move the instructions from the original block to the dominator block if possible, so in HLS, the parallelism can be improved.

This pass is based on the DominatorTreeWrapperPass in LLVM. As for the problem, what is dominator tree, please refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominator_(graph_theory).
